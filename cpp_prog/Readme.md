C++ is a multi-paradigm programming language that supports **lightweight abstractions** and provides **high performance** for system-level software.

---

## Paradigms supported by C++

1. **Procedural Programming**
2. **Object-Oriented Programming**
3. **Generic Programming**
4. **Functional Programming** (since C++11)

---

## Core Highlights

- Runtime efficiency is important in C++.
- **Zero Overhead Principle** â€” you pay only for what you use.
- Classes with constructors, destructors, inheritance.
- Support for generic programming and lambdas (functional style).
- Direct mapping to hardware (no VM, native instruction support).
- No built-in support for persistence, garbage collection, or networking.
- C++11 introduced threading, synchronization, and parallelism features.
- Compatible with C: `struct` layouts match, allowing reuse of C libraries and system calls.
- Generic programming helps **generalize** software components for better **reuse**.
