## üß± Composite Pattern & Smart Pointers

### Why use `std::shared_ptr` in Composite Pattern?

* Manages lifetime of components in a tree-like structure.
* Allows shared ownership of nodes, enabling reuse.

### When should `std::weak_ptr` be used?

* To avoid cyclic references (e.g., child holding a back-reference to parent).

### Can `unique_ptr` be used in Composite Pattern?

* Yes, if ownership is strictly hierarchical and components are not shared.

### Best Practice:

* Use `unique_ptr` where possible.
* Use `shared_ptr` with `weak_ptr` to handle shared and non-owning relationships.

## ‚ùì Conceptual Q\&A

### üîÅ Why not use `lock()` and `unlock()` directly in C++?

**Answer**: Prefer RAII like `std::lock_guard` or `std::unique_lock` to avoid deadlocks and make code exception-safe.

### üîÑ Composite Pattern and Smart Pointers

* `shared_ptr`: automatic memory management.
* `weak_ptr`: break ownership cycles.
* `unique_ptr`: strict ownership.
* Smart pointers embody RAII.

### Smart Pointer Impact on Copy/Assignment

* `shared_ptr`: shared ownership.
* `unique_ptr`: move-only semantics.

### Which Design Patterns Leverage Smart Pointers?

* Composite, Observer, Factory, Decorator.

### What is RAII and why is it critical?

* Resource Acquisition Is Initialization: resources (locks, memory, files) are acquired and released by objects' lifetime, ensuring exception safety and no leaks.

### How does Dependency Inversion relate to testability?

* High-level modules depend on abstractions, making components easily mockable during testing.

### Why prefer interfaces over inheritance?

* Interfaces promote composition over inheritance, reducing tight coupling and supporting better modularity.

### Difference between Observer and Callback?

* Observer: multiple subscribers notified via publisher.
* Callback: single function called when event occurs.

### When to choose Strategy vs State pattern?

* Strategy: interchangeable algorithms at runtime.
* State: object changes behavior as its internal state changes.

### Factory vs Abstract Factory?

* Factory: creates one product.
* Abstract Factory: creates families of related products.

## üèõÔ∏è SOLID Principles

| Principle             | Description                                 |
| --------------------- | ------------------------------------------- |
| Single Responsibility | Each class does one thing                   |
| Open/Closed           | Open for extension, closed for modification |
| Liskov Substitution   | Subtypes replace base types                 |
| Interface Segregation | Small, specific interfaces                  |
| Dependency Inversion  | Depend on abstractions                      |

* Fast, zero-copy memory sharing.

### Message Queues

* POSIX, SysV queues.

### Signals & Semaphores

* Lightweight signaling mechanisms.

## üïπÔ∏è Synchronization Models

```cpp
std::mutex mtx;
std::condition_variable cv;
bool data_ready = false;

void producer() {
    std::lock_guard<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    data_ready = true;
    cv.notify_one();
}

void consumer() {
    std::unique_lock<std::mutex> lock(mtx);
    cv.wait(lock, [] { return data_ready; });
}
```

### 2Ô∏è‚É£ Callback (Asynchronous Event)

```cpp
void onDataReceived(const std::string& data) {
    std::cout << "Received: " << data << std::endl;
}

void asyncReceive(std::function<void(std::string)> callback) {
    std::this_thread::sleep_for(std::chrono::seconds(2));
    callback("Sensor Data");
}

int main() {
    asyncReceive(onDataReceived);
}
